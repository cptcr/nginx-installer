> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Ensure that you have the necessary permissions before running the script.**
> Some commands require **sudo/root access** to install and configure NGINX properly.

> [!TIP]
> **It's always a good idea to update your package manager before installation.**
> Run the following command based on your OS:
> ```sh
> sudo apt update  # For Debian-based distros
> sudo yum update  # For RHEL-based distros
> sudo dnf update  # For Fedora
> brew update      # For macOS
> ```

> [!WARN]
> **Incorrect configuration changes can break your web server.**
> Always back up your configuration files before modifying them:
> ```sh
> sudo cp /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.bak
> ```
